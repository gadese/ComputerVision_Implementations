## Project description

The goal of this project was to get accustomed to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and to the impact of a CNNs architecture on image recognition.

The MNIST dataset was used and the project was divided in 4 steps:

1. Observing the impact of the number of convolutional layers
  - A model with 1, 2 and 3 convolutional layers was tested.
  
2. Studying the impact of the feature map size with the best model from the previous step.
  - 6 feature map sizes were tested
  
3. Testing different layer densities for the output layer. This test was made using the best model from the previous step.
  - 7 different densities were tested.
  
4. Trying out different dropout levels. This dropout was added to the previous best model.

### Results

Using these results, a seemingly "optimal", yet simple, CNN architecture was obtained, allowing for a pretty decent accuracy at XX,XX %.

This procesure can easily be generalized to other networks and allowed me to see first-hand the effect of parameters on the results.
